# Student-Immunization-by-School
The purpose of this project is to Explore and Visualize the Immunization Data by School dataset by using relevant tools. For exploring the dataset, Jupyter Notebook was used and Tableau was used for Preliminary Data Analysis and Multivarient Analysis. I have used Naïve Bayes-GaussianNB and Logistic Regressionton to classify the immunization status of the students and showed the predictions by a plot of confusion matrix and the AUC curve to show the results of the analysis.
